v1.0.0 MetroSystem Basic Demonstration
=======================================================================
## Description
**This release provides a basic overview of our overall system workflow.**  
All the software architecture work has been completed, the system UI has been debugged, and it can correctly interact with the customer to a certain extent as we expect, and find the best route with a minimum number of stations according to the station information specified by the customer, and finally print out the route through some simple highlighting functions.

v2.0.0 MetroSystem Fully Functional Version
=======================================================================
## Description
**This release provides a fully functional version of our metro system software.**  
- Based on our last release [`v1.0.0,`](https://github.com/Alex-XJK/CS3343_Group6/releases/tag/v1.0.0) we made some improvements and adjustments.
- First, we support the dynamic selection of "Least Station" or "Least Time" as the criteria for route recommendation, so that we can provide customers with more personalized and convenient services based on the different algorithms.
- Second, we made minor fixes for some user interface and algorithm accuracy bugs.
- Finally, more systematic and in-depth testing was performed to ensure that our software products performed correctly.  

**Thanks to all the developers and customers who made valuable suggestions for our software. Thank you for your enthusiasm and support to our product!**
